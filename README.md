# The-Ricardian-Equivalence

Ricardian Equivalence theory proposes that there is a relationship between a country's debt and it's economic growth. The logic follows that as citizens observe their country's debt increase, they will reduce their consumption in anticipation of a future tax increase.

To investigate this theory, I will be looking at time-series data for Debt-to-GDP and GDP growth for all available countries from 1980 - 2015.

This study should help answer this main question:

- Is there a general relationship between public debt and economic performance
  - How do country's perform with low public and debt and high public debt
